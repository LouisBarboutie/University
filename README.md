# University

This repo contains the code from the programming courses and the LaTeX reports of the lab classes in Luxemburg.

There is some python code from Heidelberg in there as well.

Additionally there is the code from the au programs used in Bruker's TopSpin software, written during my internship at Strasbourg.
