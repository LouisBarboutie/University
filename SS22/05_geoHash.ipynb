    "There is a general problem in the study of networks or graphs, where we have to discover all pairs of objects in a set which are close to each other, for some cutoff distance $r_{cut}$ defined by embedding the objects in some kind of space.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this week's example we will look at some atoms in a box in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, but this is a very general question, we could be talking about cities on a map, mobile phone base stations, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic algorithm is to loop once over the atoms and place each one in a \"cell\" defined by its local neighbourhood.  To find neighbours we only need to compare atoms in the same cell, or in one of the $3^3-1=26$ neighbouring cells because any pair not in adjacent cells (including corners) will automatically be too far away.  This gets us a speedup from $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$, which is very valuable when calculating short-range interactions between atoms in realistic computer modelling of materials.\n",
