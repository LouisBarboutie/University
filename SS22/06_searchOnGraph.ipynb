    "# 06: Search on a Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week we applied a simple hashing algorithm (sometimes called a \"Verlet List\" or a \"Cell List\") to detect connections between pairs of objects based on distance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This week we look at what we can do with this kind of connection information, which in principle defines a network, or what is called a **graph**.  Computing mathematical problems in relation to graphs is very important in many branches of physics, consider Feynman diagrams in QED, or the meshes of irregular polygons used to represent real-world objects for meso-scale physics calculations (heat flow, fluid dynamics, mechanical stress etc), and in particular consider interaction networks in between atoms in materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to provide some code to make an **extensible array** datatype so that we can keep lists of neighbours that a given atom has, and build up a stable memory-efficient representation of the neighbourhood graph that we developed in last week's exercise.  In theory we could just make an array of size $N\\times N$ and set entry $i,j$ not equal to zero if two atoms were in contact, but obviously the cost of that is $N^2$ in memory use, so such an approach isn't practical for large systems.\n"
